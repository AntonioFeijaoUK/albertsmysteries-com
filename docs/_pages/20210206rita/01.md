Something happened while the gift was on it's way... We think someone stole it!

Luckily we think we have a clue as to where it might have...

Are you ready to uncover the mystery?


```python
print("Hello")
```

<center>
  <div class="wrapper">
    <form class="form1" action="https://www.albertsmysteries.com/20210206rita/">
      <div class="inputcontent">
          <input type="text" id="password" /><br />
          <input type="checkbox" onclick="myFunction()" />Show/Hide Password
      </div>
      <div class="buttons">
        <input
          class="orangebutton"
