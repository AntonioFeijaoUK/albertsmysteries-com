Let's head there!

Although we are too late, the thief has fled again! 

Someone has seen him though, but refuses to tell us where he went in case the thief or his associates come after him.

He can only tell us one thing... The thief was headed to an airport, where something opened in 1968 and closed again in 2015 - where is it?
