excerpt: "We got close enough to see the thief's ticket on his phone. But he has disappeared again!

We go to security and ask which flight he will be taking, but they refuse to tell us due to confidentiality issues.

They might tell us what gate, only if it can never be traced back to them!

Which gate are we going to? <br />
