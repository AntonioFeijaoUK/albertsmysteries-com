We're headed to gate 27!

Luckily, we're early and no one else has arrived!

We ask one of the people which seat the thief will be sitting in, but she won't tell us and is advising us to hurry up to change our flight ticket which we do at the help desk.

The help desk advisor overheard our conversation and tells us that what we need is in seat number 0010110.

Which seat does the thief have?
