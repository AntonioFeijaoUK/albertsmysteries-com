excerpt: "
We've landed and are following the thief into Lisbon airport.<br />

He is carrying both bags with him.<br />

We will only have short moment to distract him, while Rita looks in both bags to see which one contains her gift.<br />

We managed to distract him by playing dumb tourists, while Rita looks in the bags.<br />

In one bag is her gift, in the other a bomb!<br />

Does Rita take her gift or the bomb?"
