excerpt: "
The thief got away with the gift, and a bag filled with flight magazines but we have the bomb and we need to disarm it!<br />

There is only a user manual in Russian and a piece of paper with the following written on:<br />

<strong>You need one red + two blue + one orange!<strong><br />

Which wire do you need to cut to disarm the bomb?"
