excerpt: "
We follow the thief to Entroncamento and to the railway museum where another man is waiting for him!<br />

They look agitated while they talk.<br />

The other man decides to look in the bag that we filled with magazines.<br />

He takes them all out and something else drops on the ground!<br />

It’s “Prisoners of Geography” - Rita put her own book in there by mistake!<br />

And there’s a bookmark inside from a place Rita visited - Museu Metalurgica!<br />

Where are the criminals headed?"
