excerpt: "
We're the first on the plane when it boards, just waiting for the thief.<br />

As he arrives, we notice he has two identical bags that both fit under the seat.<br />

There is nothing we can do but fly to our destination. The captain informs us that the country we're going to has the oldest diplomatic alliance with the UK, since 1373.<br />

Where are we going?
