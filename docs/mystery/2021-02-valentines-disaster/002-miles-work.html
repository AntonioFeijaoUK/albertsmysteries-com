        <h2>002 Miles work...</h2>

        <p>Miles doesn't talk much about his work, only that he is a civil servant for the International Trade Department, which is based at 3 Whitehall.<br>
            <br>However, Miles has told Veronica that he is sometimes placed in another office, if she needs to reach him quickly.<br>
            <br>He says it is the sister building of 12 Molendini ripae.<br>
            <br>Veronica has never heard of this street but hasn't given it much thought.<br>
            <br>Where does Miles really work?
        </p>
