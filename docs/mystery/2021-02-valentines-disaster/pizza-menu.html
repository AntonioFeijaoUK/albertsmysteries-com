        <h2>Pizza!</h2>

        <p>You are invited to take part in a special zoom (belated) Valentine mystery on 28th of Feb from 1600!<br>
            <br>We can do the first hour together and then people can either stay or do the rest on their own.<br>
            <br>Also, don't forget that sustenance is required to solve mysteries.<br>
            <br>We have a special pizza recipe from our resident Italian, Dani :)<br>
            <br>The dough needs to be prepared in advance (you can cheat and use ready-made,<br> but you will be judged) and we can all have a zoom pizza party in between solving the riddles.<br>
            <br>Pizza dough recipe:
        </p>

        <pre style="background-color:rgba(23, 23, 26, 0.5); text-align:left; font-size: 14px;">
                400g flour, type 0
                7g dried yeast
                10g sugar
                1 tsp salt
                230-250ml lukewarm water
        </pre>

        <p>Mix all together to form a dough.<br>
            <br>Leave to rise for 1h in a bowl covered with cling film at room temperature.<br>
            <br>(for example, leave inside the oven with light on but the oven turned off)<br>
            <br>
            <br>After 1 hour, fold the dough in 3 (see picture) and leave to rise for another hour.<br>
            <br>Do this every hour for 3 hours.<br>
            <br>Roll dough into two pizza bases.<br>
            <br>Topping ideas (you can use whatever you want, but these are Italian-approved):
        </p>

        <pre style="background-color:rgba(23, 23, 26, 0.5); text-align:left; font-size: 14px;">
                Passata (or small cherry tomatoes cut in pieces)
                Mozzarella (squeeze the water out and grate it generously over the pizza)
                Oregano
                Speck and brie
                Capers and anchovies
                Baked ham and olives
                Gorgonzola and radicchio
        </pre>

        <p>Bake at approx 200-230 C degrees for 10 minutes
            <br> (...or until the dough is done and the cheese is melted on top.)
        </p>

        <p>Mystery game coming soon...</p>
