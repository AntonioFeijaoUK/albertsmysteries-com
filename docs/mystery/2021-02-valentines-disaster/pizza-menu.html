            <h2>Pizza!</h2>

            <p>You are invited to take part in a special zoom (belated) Valentine mystery on 28th of Feb from 1600!
                <br>
                <br>We can do the first hour together and then people can either stay or do the rest on their own.
                <br>
                <br>Also, don't forget that sustenance is required to solve mysteries.<br>
                <br>We have a special pizza recipe from our resident Italian, Dani :)<br>
                <br>The dough needs to be prepared in advance (you can cheat and use ready-made, but you will be judged) and we can all have a zoom pizza party in between solving the riddles.<br>
                <br>Pizza dough recipe:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>400g flour, type 0</li>
                    <li>7g dried yeast</li>
                    <li>10g sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>230-250ml lukewarm water</li>
                </ul>
                <br>Mix all together to form a dough.<br>
                <br>Leave to rise for 1h in a bowl covered with cling film at room temperature.<br>
                <br>(for example, leave inside the oven with light on but the oven turned off)<br>
                <br>
                <br>After 1 hour, fold the dough in 3 (see picture) and leave to rise for another hour.<br>
                <br>Do this every hour for 3 hours.<br>
                <br>Roll dough into two pizza bases.<br>
                <br>Topping ideas (you can use whatever you want, but these are Italian-approved):<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Passata (or small cherry tomatoes cut in pieces)</li>
                    <li>Mozzarella (squeeze the water out and grate it generously over the pizza)</li>
                    <li>Oregano</li>
                    <li>Speck and brie</li>
                    <li>Capers and anchovies</li>
                    <li>Baked ham and olives</li>
                    <li>Gorgonzola and radicchio</li>
                </ul>
                <br>Bake at approx 200-230 C degrees for 10 minutes<br>
                <br>(...or until the dough is done and the cheese is melted on top.)<br>
            </p>
