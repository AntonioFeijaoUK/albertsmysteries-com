            <h2>Pizza!</h2>

            <p>You are invited to take part in a special zoom (belated) Valentine mystery on 28th of Feb from 1600!<br>
                <br>We can do the first hour together and then people can either stay or do the rest on their own.<br>
                <br>Also, don't forget that sustenance is required to solve mysteries.<br>
                <br>We have a special pizza recipe from our resident Italian, Dani :)<br>
                <br>The dough needs to be prepared in advance (you can cheat and use ready-made,<br> but you will be judged) and we can all have a zoom pizza party in between solving the riddles.<br>
                <br>Pizza dough recipe:
            </p>

            <p style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); text-align:left; font-size: 20px; padding-left: 25%;">
                400g flour, type 0<br> 7g dried yeast<br> 10g sugar<br> 1 tsp salt<br> 230-250ml lukewarm water</p>



            <p>Mix all together to form a dough.<br>
                <br>Leave to rise for 1h in a bowl covered with cling film at room temperature.<br>
                <br>(for example, leave inside the oven with light on but the oven turned off)<br>
                <br>
                <br>After 1 hour, fold the dough in 3 (see picture) and leave to rise for another hour.<br>
                <br>Do this every hour for 3 hours.<br>
                <br>Roll dough into two pizza bases.<br>
                <br>Topping ideas (you can use whatever you want, but these are Italian-approved):
            </p>

            <p style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); text-align:left; font-size: 20px; padding-left: 25%;">
                Passata (or small cherry tomatoes cut in pieces)<br> Mozzarella (squeeze the water out and grate it generously over the pizza)<br> Oregano
                <br> Speck and brie<br> Capers and anchovies<br> Baked ham and olives<br> Gorgonzola and radicchio</p>

            <p>Bake at approx 200-230 C degrees for 10 minutes
                <br> (...or until the dough is done and the cheese is melted on top.)
            </p>
