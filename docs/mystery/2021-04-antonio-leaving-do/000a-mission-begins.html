            <p>It's Friday afternoon and the team is having a relaxing game of dungeons and dragons!</p>

            <p>Duncan's phone has audibly been going off a few times, but everyone has politely ignored it.</p>

            <p>The 5th time his phone rings, Duncan pauses the game and goes on mute to take his phone call while the rest of the team ponder strategy and sipping drinks.</p>

            <p>
              Five minutes later, Duncan comes back and excitedly tells everyone about an old friend from his oilrig days, Miles, who has asked for Duncan's help to get a package
              out of the oilrig.
            </p>

            <p>Miles is staying on the oilrig for another month, but he was quite adamant that the package leaving is rather time sensitive.</p>

            <p>Duncan trusts Miles explicitly, so has promised to help. As it is a bit of an undertaking, Duncan asks the whole team to come and help him!</p>

            <p>Are you ready to help Miles?</p>
