            <h2>008 Porsche 911 ignition...</h2>

          <p>
            After radioing in <i>New York</i>, Miles sets off the drone and instructs it to land in the catamaran.<br>
            <br>
            Once the drone is safely packed away, Alex starts to navigate the boat back to shore.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly a radio message comes in from Miles: <strong><i>"7 weaponised drones are following you!"</i></strong><br>
            <br>
            Dave shouts to Tom that all that clay pigeon shooting better not have been for nothing, as Tom readies the rifle and takes aim!<br>
            <br>
            With Duncan and Dave helping Alex, Tom starts to aim at the drones which are starting to shoot at the team in the boat.<br>
            <br>
            The boat picks up the wind and speeds across the sea, with Tom aiming and managing to incapacitate some of the weaponised drones.<br>
            <br>
            Getting closer to the shore, only 2 of 7 drones remain, but they are still shooting at the boat, creating some holes in the body and holes in the sail.<br>
            <br> 
            Alex realises they will not make it to the harbour, so changes course to reach a nearby beach.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tom fires at one of the drones, successfully shooting one of them down.<br>
            <br>
            With only one bullet left to fire, the catamaran reaches the shore, the team jumps out, breaking into a run.<br>
            <br>
            The drone has momentarily lost them, giving them a small time advantage.
            <br>
            <br>
            Reaching a parking area, Dave immediately spots his favourite car, a Porsche 911.<br>
            <br>
            Tom blasts open the lock with the last bullet.<br>
            <br>
            Dave starts to fiddle with the cables to start the car, while the drone has picked them up again and is flying towards them and will reach the team in two minutes.<br>
            <br>
            Dave needs to connect the yellow wire to another colour wire to start the car.<br>
            <br>
            The only clue is in a little handwritten note:
          </p>

          <p style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); text-align: left; font-size: 20px; padding-left: 25%; padding-top: 1%; padding-bottom: 1%;">
            One red + two blue + one orange
        </p>

          <p>
              Which colour wire is Dave looking for?
